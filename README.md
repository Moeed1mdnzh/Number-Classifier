# Number-Classifier

This program is supposed to predict hand-written digits using the HOG(Histogram Oriented Gradient) and SVM(Support Vector machine)
algorithm in OpenCV.You simply draw a number and just set the "RESPOND" slider-trackbar to 1 and it will predict it.Set the"RESET" slider to 1
to clean the board for drawing.You are also able to change the pen size.The predictions can be wrong sometimes.Also the program is sensitive to 
multi digit numbers so it won't be able to classify them.
