# Number-Classifier

This program is supposed to predict hand-written digits using the HOG(Histogram Oriented Gradient) and SVM(Support Vector machine)
algorithm in OpenCV.You simply draw a number and just set the "RESPOND" slider-trackbar to 1 and it will predict it.Set the"RESET" slider to 1
to clean the board for drawing.You are also able to change the pen size.The predictions can be wrong sometimes.
